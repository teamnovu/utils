Resolve a tags in v-html to nuxt valid links
=================

This utility takes the raw html data, usually provided and generated by the backend, and either converts the links to "<a>" tags or if the links points to a entry, pushes it into the router. So the nuxt Router behavior is maintained.


This is mostly a fork of [nuxt-interpolation](https://github.com/daliborgogic/nuxt-interpolation).


## Setup

Add the '@teamnovu/utils' package and add it to your nuxt config file under build.transpile.

You can find a more detailed description on the [main](https://github.com/teamnovu/utils) page. 



## Usage

```vue
  <div
    v-linkresolver
    v-html="termsText"
  />
```

To each element you want converted you add the `v-linkresolver` property. The plugin will handel the rest. Feel free to add css classes and so on if you like.
